There are 3 layers to an IOT ecosystem
1. **Data collection layer** -- Where sensors gather information
2. **Networking and security layer** -- the physical network
3. **Analytics layer** -- where data is run through analytics engines

### Protocols
- **Modbus** -- Can connect up to 247 nodes in the link
- **DNP3** -- Distributed network protocol. Used by electric and water companies
- **Profinet** -- uses tcp/ip potocol. Ued by motion control and precision control is needed
- **MQTT** -- Lightweight. Sends simple data flows from sensors to applications
- **CoAP** -- Constrained Application Protocol. Used for web like applications. It was created to be used with wireless devices. Supports HTTP status codes
- **DDS** -- Data distributed Service. Used for real time, scalable performance.
- **AMQP** -- Advanced Message queing protocol.  Designed for high interoperability
- **Bluetooth**
- **ZigBee** -- low powered, low latency. Used in industrial and home automation
- **LoRaWan** -- Low Range WAN. Designed for large networks (think smart cities)
